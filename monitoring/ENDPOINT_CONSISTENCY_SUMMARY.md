# Monitoring Endpoint Consistency - Fixed

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### Issue Identified
The monitoring endpoints were inconsistent between EC2 (nginx.conf) and Kubernetes (client-nginx-config.yaml) configurations.

### Changes Made

#### 1. **EC2 nginx.conf** (`client/nginx.conf`)
- ‚úÖ Added missing monitoring endpoints under `/monitor/` prefix
- ‚úÖ All Spring Boot services now expose metrics via `/monitor/{service}/actuator/`
- ‚úÖ GenAI service health now available at `/monitor/genai/health`

#### 2. **Kubernetes ConfigMap** (`k8s/client-nginx-config.yaml`) 
- ‚úÖ Updated GenAI health endpoint from `/genai/health` to `/monitor/genai/` 
- ‚úÖ Ensured consistent trailing slashes and routing patterns
- ‚úÖ All monitoring endpoints now use the `/monitor/` prefix consistently

#### 3. **Documentation Updates**
- ‚úÖ Updated `monitoring/RESULTS_GUIDE.md` with correct GenAI endpoint
- ‚úÖ Updated `monitoring/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` with consistent paths
- ‚úÖ All documentation now reflects the `/monitor/` prefix consistently

## üéØ Current Monitoring Endpoints

### **Both EC2 and Kubernetes deployments now provide:**

#### Prometheus Metrics:
- Authentication: `/monitor/auth/prometheus`
- Course Service: `/monitor/course/prometheus`  
- Review Service: `/monitor/review/prometheus`
- Recommendation Gateway: `/monitor/gateway/prometheus`

#### Health Checks:
- Authentication: `/monitor/auth/health`
- Course Service: `/monitor/course/health`
- Review Service: `/monitor/review/health`
- Recommendation Gateway: `/monitor/gateway/health`
- GenAI Service: `/monitor/genai/health`

## üîç Verification

You can now test any of these endpoints on your domain:
```bash
# Example for Kubernetes deployment:
curl https://k83-client-app.student.k8s.aet.cit.tum.de/monitor/auth/health
curl https://k83-client-app.student.k8s.aet.cit.tum.de/monitor/auth/prometheus
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Deploy the updated configurations** to see the consistent monitoring endpoints
2. **Test the endpoints** to verify they're working as expected  
3. **Optional**: Add Prometheus to your local development stack if you want full metrics visualization

All monitoring endpoints are now **consistent, documented, and ready for use** across both deployment environments!
